versus race: 		just the tracks, no collectables (but shortcuts), multiplayer, 
			optionally turn off stage hazards, item, ai drivers
tutorial/settings mode: explains every character (text), lets you test him on a test stage, change controlls, 
			tutorial for base game (gets forced on you when starting new safe file (is skippable tho), proceeds into story mode)
			difficulty can be chosen when starting new file, can be changed later in settings
original modes 		(time trial, etc.)
story mode: 		hubworld, original 5 maps (maximum optical revamps, no gameplay-changing stuff allowed), 
				you have to collect every chaos emerald, if you have them you get a
				secret race, then bossfight with eggman on/after radiant emerald as super sonic
			hubworld ideas: circular room, racing themed, in 4 directions are teleportes to each map,
				7 pedestals for chaos emeralds in the middle of the room, if all are collected, 
				jumping inside transforms sonic, making him fly towards radiant emerald
					question: is player able to play tracks multiple times? if yes: why? 
						how to determine when eggman steals the winners cup? (cutscene)
				going inside a gate doesnt start the race but sends you to the starting region of the track, 
					where you can start the race by talking to an npc, 
					or practice the track by just walking through it, 
					but all rings and collectibles as well as their traces are gone 
					rendereing collecting them or opening shortcuts impossible

			premise: the winners cup (only 4 tracks) contains some powerfull item, eggman tries to win to get it, 
				takes it anyways after he lost 
			if you play it through, you unlock eggman (and R super sonic?) for every mode, 
				as well as the abillity to play as other characters in storymode (adds terminal ans icons next to gates)
				Collectables beside chaos emeralds also appear, making more characters unlockable
				added sonic tokens (and classic tokens) on radiant emerald
					question: how to lock/unlock modern super sonic, he is way too strong, 
						maybe something with radiant emerald (sonic tokens)
						if he collects classic tokens: R eggman or R super sonic?
					possible solutions: make him unlock R super sonic on playthrough, 
							trolling him with not giving him "real", op super sonic, 
							but also showing him theres classic characters
						for classic eggman he has to collect classic tokens 
						and for modern super sonic he has to collect/defeat something in all 4 normal stages, 
							which then unlocks (very hard to reach) super sonic tokens on radiant emerald. 
							also maybe beating super sonic in the following race is like the hardest thing ever
					question: how and will it be possible to rechallenge eggman?
					possible solution: maybe he's hanging around at the radiant emerald starting area, offering a rematch
						if you play as eggman himself, there instead is an egg robo, 
							offering his master (you) training, 
								if accepted he transforms into a grey (metallic) version of the eggman bossfight
grand prix: 		unlocked when beating story mode
			all tracks in one go
			collectables exist, get calculated like originals (tokens if 3rd or better, emeralds only if first)
			add to score at end of race 
				(e.g. normal win: 15 points, emerald +5 points, tokens: +1 point each, bonus if all)
				bonus points if complete emeralds/tokens at end of grand prix
			clearing the emerald/token challenge (and getting first place overall) unlocks special cups
				e.g. mario kart cup (e.g. mushroom bridge), sanic ball cup?
			beating those unlocks secret characters 
				(e.g mario character (maybe shuy guy)(in a kart), sanic as a ball)
			beating something with all of those unlocks final oc
				beating something with final char gives super special credits

credits:		first type (most lame one) after beating all 4 stages in storymode (1st time)
(maybe in options menu)	second type after defeating eggman
				subsequent credits (only slightly changed according to original game) 
				after beating story mode with other characters (all icons next to stages)
					skippable
			third one after beating grand prix number one (skippable the second time)
				subsequent credits after beating special cups respectively (skippable)
			fourth one when fulfilling requirements for final character
			final one when beating last challenge with final character
