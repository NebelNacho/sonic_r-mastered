original 9 unchanged (unlockable with new collectables in stages)
names begin with an R (e.g. R Sonic)
unlocking character will also unlock the original music track for that stage
	question: do sonic tokens now unlock modern robo chars? and if yes: how do you unlock the R robos?

idea note: special attack items?

new abillity button: normal use: sidestep (replaces f-zero-like hard turn (L and R button) on modern characters (R characters keep it))

additional characters

modern sonic 		- homing attack: less height, more speed
			- when hitting a destructable object /stage hazard while in jump or homing state destroys it, 
				bouncing of and gaining 50% horizontal speed
			- sidestep (like in sonic 3d games/stages)
modern super sonic 	- chaos control: a fast airborne dash forward
		   	- floats like tails
			- floats over water
			- can fly through stage hazards (destroys them)
			- sidestep galore
			- the fastest one (does have same accelleration like sonic, but waaaay higher speedcap)
modern tails 		- able to tap the button repeadetly to gain height, able to run tired like sonic 2
			- can sidestep also while airborne
modern knuckles		- when canceling glide on a certain height, lands with a punch, creating a shockwave 
				(hurts and maybe pushes other racers, destroys stage hazards)
			- sidestep (only on ground)
modern amy:		- first of all, of course she has her most recent design, not the sonic cd one
			- more sporty car
			- drifting instead of sidestep, gives minor boost on release, charges boost ability 
				(that one that she has when pressing the jump button, it also has a visible meter now)
			- nerf: hovercraft transformation has a time limit, 
				not able to boost or drift while in hovercraft state
			- plays like a "normal" racecar
modern eggman:		- keeps homing missiles
			- speed nerf i guess
			- holding sidestep buttons creates a shield 
				that gives minor buff on speed while on and recharges over time when not used
